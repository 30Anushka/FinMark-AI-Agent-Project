# 🧱 Phase 1 — Seed Data Generation with Faker

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this phase is to **build the base (seed) dataset** of young professional customers using the **Faker** library.  
This dataset serves as the foundation for all subsequent synthetic modeling and behavioral simulations.

The focus is to generate **realistic but fully synthetic** customer attributes, financial variables, and initial behavioral tables in a privacy-safe way.



## 🧩 Datasets Created

| Dataset | Description | Approx. Rows |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| `customers.csv` | Core profile of young professionals aged 23–40 with income, credit, and balance data. | ~2 000 |
| `transactions.csv` | Monthly and lifestyle transactions (rent, groceries, travel, entertainment, etc.). | ~50 000 |
| `campaign_events.csv` | Simulated marketing interactions (opened, clicked, converted, ignored). | ~8 000 |



## 🧠 Data Schema — `customers.csv`

| Column | Description |
