# 💰 FinMark AI Agent — Synthetic Financial Simulation

This project builds an **AI-driven synthetic financial ecosystem** using Faker and SDV (CTGAN + HMA).  
It simulates **customer profiles, transactions, marketing responses, and monthly financial behavior**, enabling safe and realistic experimentation for fintech product and marketing strategy design.



## 🧱 Phase 1 — Seed Data Generation
**Tools:** Faker, Pandas  
- Generated ~2000 young professional customer profiles.  
- Added behavioral data: transactions and campaign responses.  

**Outputs:**
- `customers.csv`, `transactions.csv`, `campaign_events.csv`



## 🌆 Phase 2 — Synthetic Expansion (SDV: CTGAN + HMA)
**Tools:** SDV (CTGANSynthesizer, HMASynthesizer), Matplotlib  
- Expanded customers → 10,000 synthetic profiles.  
- Preserved multi-table relationships using HMA Synthesizer.  
- Validated data realism via SDV quality scores and KS tests.

**Outputs:**
- `customers_ctgan_10000.csv`
- `customers_hma_10000.csv`
- `transactions_hma_10000.csv`
- `campaigns_hma_10000.csv`

**Evaluation Results:**
- Single-table CTGAN Quality Score: **0.882**
- Multi-table HMA Quality Score: **0.881**
- Distributions realistic; minor correlation drift observed.



## 💼 Phase 3 — Financial Behavior Simulation
**Goal:** Simulate monthly money behavior for each synthetic customer.  
**Logic:** Each customer assigned a persona →  
- **Saver** (high savings, low risk)  
- **Spender** (low savings, high consumption)  
- **Investor** (moderate spending, consistent investing)  
- **Risk-Taker** (volatile behavior)

**Output:**
- `financial_behavior.csv` (12 months × customers)
- Columns: `customer_id, month, persona, income, spending, savings, investments, loan_repayment, balance`


## 📊 Example Visuals
| Persona | Behavior |
|----------|-----------|
| Saver | Balance grows steadily each month |
| Spender | High fluctuations, lower ending balance |
| Investor | Moderate growth + investment activity |
| Risk-Taker | Irregular spikes and dips |
